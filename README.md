CMV is a β-herpesvirus that infects 40 – 100 % of the population worldwide in a latent form. It not only can cause substantial morbidity and mortality in immune-compromised patients but also alters the immune response in healthy individuals. In this tutorial, we will perform a meta-analysis to reveal the effect of latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) on the circulating immune cells. The meta-analysis will use data from three studies publicly available in the ImmPort database^1^ ( [SDY113](http://www.immport.org/immport-open/public/study/study/displayStudyDetail/SDY113), [SDY311](http://www.immport.org/immport-open/public/study/study/displayStudyDetail/SDY311) and [SDY515](http://www.immport.org/immport-open/public/study/study/displayStudyDetail/SDY515))^2-4^. This tutorial is designed to help you gain hands-on experience in the following areas:

1. R programming
2. Data wrangling with ImmPort data
3. Automated cell gating of CyTOF data
4. Meta-analysis


To run the tutorial:

1. Download the study folders of SDY113, SDY311, and SDY515 from the ImmPort database 
2. Place the downloaded folders into the "Data" folder of this tutorial. 
3. Open the "Focis_tutorial.Rmd" using Rstudio run the code blocks. 
4. Alternatively, hit the "knit" button on Rstudio to generate an HTML output.
