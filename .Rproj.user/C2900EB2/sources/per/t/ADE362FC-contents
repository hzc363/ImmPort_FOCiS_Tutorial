## 1. Introduction to GTEX data

The GTEX data profiles the RNA transcripts levels in 44 tissues
from 449 individuals (70â€“361 samples per tissue) for a total of 7,051
transcriptomes. This dataset allows us to characterize how the dark ion channels are expressed in different human tissues.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='asis',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../Data/GTEX_intro.jpg")
cat("**\n Fig.1: The GTEX data profiles the RNA transcripts levels in 44 tissues
from 449 individuals.**")
```

## 2. Strategy for priotizing dark ion channels.

To prioritizing dark ion channels, I made the following assumptions:

* Highly expressed dark ion channels should have higher priorities than "silent" ion channels. 
* If the expression level of several dark ion channels are highly
correlated, they may form a functional complex or being functionally redundant. These dark ion channels should be prioritized. 

## 3. Examine the expression of dark ion channels. 
First, I identified all genes the are associated with the gene ontology term "ion channel". These genes include dark ion channels and other ion channels that are well studied. I then looked at their expression in the GTEX data. I found that 49 genes (including 15 dark ion channels) have very low expression throughout human tissues (log2 RPKM < -10). These genes should be de-prioritized in our study. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,results='asis',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,cache=FALSE}

include_graphics("../Result/01_MAD_vs_Mean.pdf")

cat("**\n Fig.2: A plot showing the mean expression and variation of ion channel associated genes in human tissues. Red represent dark ion genes.**")
```

The following table summarize the dark ion channels that have low expression level. These genes should be **de-prioritized**. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,results='asis',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,cache=FALSE}
dark_df0 = read.csv("../Result/01_dark_IC_expression_info_low.csv")
kable(dark_df0)
```

## 4. Find the dark channels that form correlation clusters

I clustered the ion channels genes based on their expression correlation. We can see that some dark ion channels cluster together. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,results='asis',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,cache=FALSE}
include_graphics("../Result/01_hclust.pdf")
cat("**\n Fig.3: Clustering result for ion channels. Red represent dark ion channels. Zoom in to see more details.**")

```

The following table summarizes the dark channel clusters that contain 3 or more than 3 dark ion channels. We should prioritize genes in these clusters. 
```{r, echo=FALSE,results='asis',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,cache=FALSE}
df = read.csv("../Result/01_dark_clusters.csv")
kable(df)
```
